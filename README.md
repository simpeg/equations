# equations
A collection of modular equations that are used throughout the SimPEG ecosystem.

## Why

Equations are an example of a modular piece of text that can be reused.
Currently this is hard, and is often not done - especially not between
multiple researchers. This repository our first take at that problem
in the geophysics community where notation is often dissonant between
various research groups.

## Goals

The goals of `equations` is to provide a small repository of equations
used in geophysics.

* a collection of equations with consistent notation
* a place to flag issues and have discussions
* increase ease of reuse of equations through writing, presentations and documentation
* meta data about the equation can be provided
* attribution can be given (through citations, git commits etc.)

## Scope

We will focus on the equations used throughout the SimPEG ecosystem specifically:

* inverse problems
* optimization
* electromagnetics
* potential fields
* vadose zone fluid flow

## Alternatives

Copy paste equations. Booooo

## Connections

* Creating [modular documents](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Modular_Documents) in latex using `input` and `include`
* SimPEG project at [http://simpeg.xyz](http://simpeg.xyz)
* [GitProject](https://github.com/3ptscience/git-project) for inclusion of this repository in other writing projects
